# PITA GYROS

The dream of the small genuine place that can deliver food that tastes like Greece began many years ago. Who doesn't love a pita gyro, but how do we make it simple yet good. The idea of ​​Pita Gyros is to offer the good in an accessible and creative way. The focus is on the food, you create the experience yourself, at home, on the beach, at work or wherever you are right now.

## Features 



### Wireframe

- I started by making two simple sketches in "one note" on my iPad to get a better overall picture of the site. During the time I worked on the project, the appearance changed a little. But the basic idea is the same.

- __Menu__

  - The first idea was to make the menu fixed on the page.
  - But considering the ease of use for end users, I chose to make the menu as a file that can be easily renewed if needed.

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
