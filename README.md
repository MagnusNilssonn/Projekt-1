# PITA GYROS

The dream of the small genuine place that can deliver food that tastes like Greece began many years ago. Who doesn't love a pita gyro, but how do we make it simple yet good. The idea of ​​Pita Gyros is to offer the good in an accessible and creative way. The focus is on the food, you create the experience yourself, at home, on the beach, at work or wherever you are right now.

## Features 



### Wireframe

- I started by making two simple sketches in "one note" on my iPad to get a better overall picture of the site. During the time I worked on the project, the appearance changed a little. But the basic idea is the same.

- __Menu__

  - The first idea was to make the menu fixed on the page.
  - But considering the ease of use for end users, I chose to make the menu as a file that can be easily renewed if needed.

## Testing 

The first tests I did had some small errors that were easy to fix, my first lighthouse test however had a slightly worse performance rating (79). I debugged and found that the image on the start page was taking too long to load. This was fixed and the new grade was (99).

The site is tested on an Ipad mini, Ipad Pro, Desktop, Samsung Galaxy and Iphone Xr.

Also ran it through Jigsaw CSS Validator, W3C Html Validator and Lighthouse.
Test results follow.
